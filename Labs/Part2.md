In this exercise, you will create a news site in SharePoint and connect it to the Emergency Response team you set up in [Exercise 1](Part1.md). This exercise is optional - the remaining parts do not depend on it - so you could choose to skip it or come back to it later, and proceed directly to [Exercise 3](Part3.md)

## Step 1: Add the SharePoint connector

Begin in the Emergency Response Team you created in the previous exercise.

a. To the right of the General channel, click the elipsis 1️⃣ to open the context menu, and select Connectors 2️⃣.

c. Click Add in the screen which follows, and then Save in the screen after that to save the connector.

⛏️ WHY TWO SCREENS WHEN ADDING THE CONNECTOR? The first screen was from Microsoft Teams to make sure you're installing the right connector. The second screen with the Save button was a configuration screen provided by the Teams application. The SharePoint News connector didn't require any configuration, but you could build a connector that is configurable, allowing the user to decide what information they want sent.)

## Step 2: Add some news to the SharePoint site

a. Still in the General channel, click the elipsis in the upper right corner 1️⃣ to open the menu and select "Open in SharePoint" 2️⃣.

b. This will bring you into the SharePoint site that's associated with this Team, viewing the file folder for the channel. You may need to log in if this is the first time opening SharePoint in your new tenant. Navigate to the Home page.

You can set the heading image by clicking on the image icon to the left of the gray banner.

Search for a stock image that conveys an emergency. Notice that you can move the image around by dragging the circle in the middle. Add some text and click "Post news" to publish your news article.


Now create a News Link; search the Internet for a news story about an emergency and paste the URL. In the end, your home page should show both news items front and center.
